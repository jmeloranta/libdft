Library for Orsay-Trento helium DFT.
Compilation parameters are taken from libgrid make.conf.

Needs: libgrid and fftw.

Note: Although libgrid supports single precision floating point numbers, these are often not adequate
for calculations that propagate systems over long periods of time.

List of people how contributed to the code:

1) Lauri Lehtovaara
2) David Mateo
