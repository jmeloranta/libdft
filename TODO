- Introduce GP2 with params that match the speed of sound
- Include moving background contribution to chemical potential automatically in driver.c so that abs boundaries and imag time
  work properly with it.
- offer possibility to use potential function rather than grid
  (saves memory)
- look into eliminating workspaces in ot3d (spherical average): avoid storing
  intermediates. Perhaps adding special routines like add_ipower() etc.
  would avoid using workspaces.
- use the common propagate entry points in libgrid rather than calling aux routines directly.
