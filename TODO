- For 1D: Check energy density.

In progress: Eliminating driver.c as it adds an unnecessary extra level of complexity. This will also force the user
             to manage workspaces (avoid conflicts). Also the messy global variables will go away.
- Many things will move to libgrid
- Use libgrid routines for propagation directly (add predict-correct there etc.)
- Potential routines should be in common.c
- Initial condition routines -> initial.c

What will be left: common.c, bulk.c, initial.c, ot.c, ot-energy.c.
