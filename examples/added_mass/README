Example to compute the added mass (effective hydrodinamic mass) of an electron bubble.

This is computed as:

m_add / m_He = d^2 E / d v^2 | v=0

or in TeX notation:
\frac{m_{add}}{m_{He}} = \frac{d^2 E(v_0)}{dv_0^2}

The script "run_all.sh" launches a set of runs to minimize the total quasienergy of the electron bubble
for different values of the relative velocity between the liquid and the impurity. The values are 
selected from the "vels" variable. This velocities are given as multiples of the fundamental velocity 
for the box

v = ( 2 * pi * hbar ) / (mass * num_points * step ) 

corresponding to the largest wavenumber (i.e. smallest velocity) that can fit in the box. However, the
velocities need not be integers and numbers less than 1 are fine ---and usually needed. 

For the sake of efficiency, these runs start from the converged solution for v=0. The complex
helium wavefunction is read from the grid file "liquid_final" and the complex electron wavefunction
from "impurity_final". This can be obtained by running "added_mass" and renaming or linking the last 
ebubble_liquid-*.grd and ebubble_impurity-*.grd. The liquid_final and impurity_final do not contain 
the .grd extension to avoid being wiped out by 'make clean'.

Each run will output its own estimation of the added mass by integrating the current density. Once the
energies are converged, the added mass can be obtained from the energy by running "get_madd.sh". 
This does not compute the derivative but fits the form

E(k) = e0 - madd * (.5 * mass * v*v )

to the energies. This form is only adequate for small v values, and you can specify a range of kinetic 
energies (.5*mass*v*v) to fit via "./get_mass.sh range". A plot is shown in the screen to assest how
good the fit is. If the data doesn't fit very well try reducing the range.

__ Other scripts __

"get_data.sh" (used by get_mass.sh) outputs the 'frame of reference kinetic energy per particle', i.e.
.5 * mass * v0* v0, vs the total energy for all the velocities computed.

"total_e.sh res" outputs the evolution of the total energy from the data found in file "res".
The total energy is E = helium kinetic + helium potential + impurity kinetic. The impurity potential
is not included to avoid double counting the pair potential contribution.
